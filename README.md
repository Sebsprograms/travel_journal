# Travel Journal

This project was created using react on local environment & is a challenge project from Scrimba's react course. 

## Resource
I was given access to a figma file as a guideline from the course creator. 
[Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0%3A1)

### Spec
travel_journal/src/resources/data.js contains a javascript object that is mapped to components & dynamically rendered using props.

#### PS
If you are new to react, I highly recommend the scrimba course. It is free & more exhaustive than any tutorial I've found. The course is also up to date with development patterns such as using funcitonal components (2022) over class based (< 2021)
